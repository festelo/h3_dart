## H3 Web

***In most cases you should not use this library directly, use [h3_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/h3_dart/) or [h3_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/h3_flutter/) instead.***  

This package provides implementation of H3 abstraction from `package:h3_common` through bindings to Ubers's [h3-js](https://github.com/uber/h3-js) library written on JS.

Bindings are generated using `dart_js_facade_gen` tool.

```dart
// Get hexagons in specified triangle.
final h3 = const H3Web();
final hexagons = h3.polyfill(
  resolution: 5,
  coordinates: [
    GeoCoord(20.4522, 54.7104),
    GeoCoord(37.6173, 55.7558),
    GeoCoord(39.7015, 47.2357),
  ],
);
```  

### Setup

***In most cases you should not use this library directly, use [h3_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/h3_dart/) or [h3_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/h3_flutter/) instead.***  

This library is built on top of `h3-js`, you have to import it.  
Add next line to your `index.html`:
```html
    <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/h3-js@4.2.1"></script>
```
**Note, `main.dart.js` import should go after this line**

-------------
## For contributors:

Facade for h3-js library is placed at `h3_web/lib/src/generated/types.dart` and generated by `dart_js_facade_gen` dependency.  
To regenerate this file run `npm run generate` (Node.js should be installed)

`dart_js_facade_gen` is currently out-of-date and it does not support null-safety.  
So, while using `h3_js` you should treat any response as nullable, even if dart analyzer says it's not.  
If you want to check the response for null, you should first cast it, e.g.:
```dart
// ignore: unnecessary_cast
final res = h3_js.h3ToCenterChild(
    h3Index.toH3JS(),
    resolution,
) as String?;
```

Every responsed by h3_js list, you should also cast to avoid runtime errors:
```dart
h3_js
    .polyfill(coordinates.map((e) => [e.lat, e.lon]).toList(), resolution)
    .cast<String>() // here, althrough `polyfill` method declaration says it returns List<String>
    .map((e) => e.toBigInt())
```
